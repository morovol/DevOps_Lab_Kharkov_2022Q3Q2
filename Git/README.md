## Write common sides and differences between merge and rebase commands.
Reading the official Git manual it states that rebase “reapplies commits on top of another base branch”, whereas merge “joins two or more development histories together”. In other words, the key difference between merge and rebase is that while merge preserves history as it happened, rebase rewrites it.
## Write pros and cons for merge and rebase. Describe situations for preferably usage of these commands.
 - Conflicting changes
 - Published branches
 - Loss of data
